# customer-ranking

Simple app intended to rank customers based on how valuable they are to a business. 

A customer is considered valuable if its score is greater than (mean - standard deviation) of scores. This obviously is not intended to be intelligent at all :)

Start app with "runhaskell Main.hs"
